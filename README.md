The `freq` parameter in the `pd.date_range` function from the pandas library specifies the frequency of the date intervals in the generated date range. It determines how often dates should be generated between the start and end dates.

### Common Frequency Strings:

- `'D'`: Daily frequency (e.g., every day).
- `'B'`: Business day frequency (e.g., weekdays only).
- `'W'`: Weekly frequency.
- `'M'`: Month-end frequency.
- `'H'`: Hourly frequency.
- `'T'` or `'min'`: Minute frequency.
- `'S'`: Second frequency.

### Example in the Code

In the given function `generate_initial_price_data`, the `freq='D'` parameter is used:

```python
def generate_initial_price_data(num_days=100, seed=42):
    np.random.seed(seed)
    dates = pd.date_range(start='2022-01-01', periods=num_days, freq='D')
    data = {
        'Open': np.random.uniform(low=100, high=200, size=num_days),
        'High': np.random.uniform(low=100, high=200, size=num_days),
        'Low': np.random.uniform(low=100, high=200, size=num_days),
        'Close': np.random.uniform(low=100, high=200, size=num_days),
    }
    df = pd.DataFrame(data, index=dates)
    return df
```

### Explanation:

- `start='2022-01-01'`: Specifies the starting date of the range.
- `periods=num_days`: Specifies the number of periods (days) to generate.
- `freq='D'`: Specifies that the frequency of the date range should be daily.

### Generated Date Range

With `freq='D'`, if `num_days=100`, the date range will consist of 100 consecutive days starting from '2022-01-01'. The resulting dates would be '2022-01-01', '2022-01-02', '2022-01-03', ..., up to '2022-04-10'.

### Importance in the Context:

- The `freq='D'` parameter ensures that each row in the generated DataFrame corresponds to a single day, which is typical for daily financial data such as stock prices.
- Using different frequencies (e.g., `'B'` for business days or `'H'` for hourly data) would adjust the generated date intervals accordingly, allowing for different types of time series data generation.

### Practical Implications:

- **Daily Data**: Suitable for most stock price simulations, as stock prices are typically recorded daily.
- **Business Days**: Useful for financial markets where data is only recorded on weekdays.
- **Hourly or Minute Data**: Can be used for high-frequency trading simulations or more granular data analysis.

By setting `freq='D'`, the script is configured to simulate daily stock prices, which is a common requirement in financial data analysis and trading strategy simulations.
